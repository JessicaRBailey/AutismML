# Autistic Spectrum Disorder Screening Predicter Model


## Introduction


Our project is a comprehensive analysis of toddler autism spectrum disorder (ASD) screening data. In this project, we dive deeper into the dataset to uncover valuable insights, trends, and key observations regarding the early detection of autism in young children. Our primary goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the various factors linked with autism's early identification and understand more potential questions that could contribute to developing an early detection system.

We employ a combination of supervised learning techniques and neural network models to achieve these objectives. Additionally, we have designed and deployed a user-friendly survey on our website, seamlessly integrated with a database system, to efficiently collect and manage the essential data for this analysis. In this README, we will provide essential information, instructions, and insights regarding our project, helping you navigate through our findings and methodologies.

## CSV to SQLite Database Converter

This Python script is designed to import data from a CSV file into an SQLite database and retrieve and display the data from the database. It uses the Pandas library for data manipulation and Matplotlib for data visualization.



### Configuration

- Ensure that your SQLite database file name is set as SQLITE.db. You can change this name in the database_name variable if needed.
- Make sure the CSV file you want to import is located within the "Resources" folder. You can change the file path in the csv_file_path variable if necessary.


### Data Import

The script creates an SQLite database if it doesn't exist and creates a table with specified columns to store the data.
It imports data from the CSV file into the SQLite table, skipping the header row.

### Data Retrieval and Visualization

The script retrieves data from the SQLite database and displays it in a readable format.
Data visualization using Matplotlib is supported but commented out. Uncomment the appropriate lines to enable data visualization.
